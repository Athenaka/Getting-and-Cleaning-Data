#Activity Labels
#WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
#WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
#WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
#SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
#STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
#LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

#The R scirpt variables are:
#activitylabels: Is the data set for activity labes.
#features: Is the data set for activities.
#featuresneeded: This will only include the data required for the analysis.
#trainActivities: Is the data set for training activities.
#testActivities: Is the data set for test activities.
#allData: Is the combination of test and training data.
